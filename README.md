# Simple-Toy-Car

Basic toy car project for a kid.  

Initially developed firmware using an STM8S105 board (code worked) but the chip got fried due to some power issues.  
Decided to use a TI TM4C123 I had lying around. Developed the code using the TivaWare library and everything worked well 
until the USB port got damaged and for some reason, the board doesn't seem to work under external power.

The STM8 and TM4C123 codes are in the Deprecated folder as they won't be used for the final prototype.
